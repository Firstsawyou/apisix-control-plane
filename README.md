# apisix-control-plane

apisix-control-plane provide APISIX with a yaml configuration capability

Why do you want to do this?
1. In order to facilitate the integration of k8s, use yaml to define APISIX;
2. For easier synchronization across clusters;
3. Can be better adapted to multiple platforms (k8s, vm);

Here are some examples of yaml and we can add comments here.
